# Instruction
In order to execute the solution locally, python and pseudo API for Google trends (pytrends) should be installed.

# Monitor
Google might lock out from the servers and to handle this situation exceptions handling is used.

# Data quality
To ensure data quality, checks for dataframe size should be implemented. Moreover null values should behandled as well. 
For example, if country is null when such lines should be removed.
